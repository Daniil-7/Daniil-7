Hi everyone, my name is <b>Daniil</b> and I've been working in *IT for more than two years*. During this time I managed to work on developing websites on *Django framework as a freelancer*, and also got a job in a large gaming company as a *tester*, where I reached <b>QA Middle</b> position. In addition, as a hobby and my main learning project, I am *developing my own game on Unity*.
